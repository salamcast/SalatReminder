Salat Reminder is just another tool to help remind us to remember Allah Subhannah Wa'Tallah while living in the west with our busy schedules.  In Canada I don't have the luxury of hearing the Azan being called out loud in our streets everyday, like in many Muslim countries;  This adds to the challenge of living Islam and being a good Muslim, since we are not always in the company of our brothers and sisters in Islam.  \r\n\r\nSalat Reminder is a simple ATOM feed generator that displays todays Salat timings based on your ip addresses geographical location and are sourced from Islamic Finders Prayer Web service. The default options can be configured in the config.ini file;  I've added some comments to help you configure it to your needs.  Please note that if you're using a proxy of any kind your results will most likely be incorrect.  For example, the Mc Donaldâ€™s wifi I'm using in Toronto, Canada is piped through Washington DC in the USA.  The title of the feed will have the current city and country; if you're in doubt, look up the timings from a source that matches your location.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Dependancies:\r\n\r\n- [ip2locationlite.class](http://ipinfodb.com/ip_location_api.php)\r\n- [Universal Feed Generator](http://www.phpclasses.org/package/4427-PHP-Generate-feeds-in-RSS-1-0-2-0-an-Atom-formats.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Web Services used:\r\n\r\n- [IP Info DB:](http://ipinfodb.com/)\r\n- [Earth Tools](http://www.earthtools.org/webservices.htm)\r\n- [IslamicFinder.org](http://www.islamicfinder.org/prayerService.php?timezone=-5.0&dayLight=1&pmethod=5&fajrTwilight1=&ishaTwilight=0&fajrTwilight2=&ishaInterval=0&HanfiShafi=1&dhuhrInterval=1&maghribInterval=1&city=toronto&state=ON&zipcode=&country=canada&calculate=1&lang=english#xml_link)\r\n\r\n\r\n## IP Info DB config\r\nIt is very important that you get a free API key for ipinfodb and copy and paste it into a file called \".ht_ipinfodb.ini\" (the .ht is to prevent the file from being viewed on the web, as per default apache httpd config), this is a basic template, just replace the text in key with the real key:\r\n\r\n    ;-----------------------------------------\r\n    ; Example of .ht_ipinfodb.ini\r\n    ;-----------------------------------------\r\n    [api]\r\n    key=\"<api key |ljdslfddfsldfhjdfsjhdfs>\"\r\n    ;-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nPlease download this and run it on your own web server, this will help keep the feed generating nicely.\r\nEarthTools and IP Info DB are free services and shouldn't be abused by your scripts,  Inshallah my\r\nscripts don't.  If you notice any mistakes in my readme or code or calculations, please feel free to let me know. Here is a [demo](http://www.salamcast.com/demos/SalatCast/) you can can try out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
